# Video_Games_Ratings_from_structural_characteristics

My name is Ravi Kant Sharma and this is the details of capstone project submission for Imarticus Learning Institute in Data Analyst certificate program titled, â€œGames Rating! Investigating the Structural Characteristics that Make Highly-Rated Video Games.
In this project, I use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to extract structural characteristics of video games to predict a rating score (meta score). I also perform various methods of data visualization and communication to convey findings and actionable insights.


In this Data, Column Description is :
name: contains the name/title of the video game
platform: contains the computer system the game runs on
release_date: the date when the game was released; includes the Month, Day and Year (in that order)
summary: the game's premise; includes 'Game of the Year' tag
meta_score: meta score received; integer from 0-100
user_review: user score received; decimal from 0-10
